Auxiliary -	Scanning, fuzzing, sniffing, and admin capabilities. Offer extra assistance and functionality.
Encoders -	Ensure that payloads are intact to their destination.
Exploits -	Defined as modules that exploit a vulnerability that will allow for the payload delivery.
NOPs -	(No Operation code) Keep the payload sizes consistent across exploit attempts.
Payloads -	Code runs remotely and calls back to the attacker machine to establish a connection (or shell).
Plugins -	Additional scripts can be integrated within an assessment with msfconsole and coexist.
Post -	Wide array of modules to gather information, pivot deeper, etc.
