Tools can indeed, in some cases, present us with some downsides:

Create a comfort zone that will be hard to break out of to learn new skills

Create a security risk just because they are published online for everyone to see and use

Create a tunnel vision effect. If the tool cannot do it, neither can I.

Like in other industries where the creative part of the work can be combined with automated tasks, tools can limit our view and actions as new users.
We can mistakenly learn that they provide the solutions to all problems, and we start to rely on them more and more.
This, in turn, creates a tunnel vision effect that can and will limit the possible interactions that the user might think about and act upon for their assessment.

The old way would have been to run msfupdate in our OS terminal (outside msfconsole).
However, the apt package manager can currently handle the update of modules and features effortlessly.
