Authentication, at its core, is the validation of your identity by presenting a combination of four factors to a validation mechanism. They are:

Something you know: a password, passcode, pin, etc.
Something you have: an ID Card, security key, or other MFA tools
Something you are: your physical self, username, email address, or other identifiers
Somewhere you are: geolocation, IP address, etc.
